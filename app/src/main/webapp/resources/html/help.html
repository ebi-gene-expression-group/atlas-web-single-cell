        <h3>How to search in Single Cell Expression Atlas</h3>
        <p>
            Here you can use the <b>Gene search box</b> to search whether a gene comprises part of a cell type
            expression profile. You may search its gene ID via its gene symbol or name (e.g. <i>APOA2</i>). A
            dropdown box will appear showing related gene symbols and species-specific results to choose from.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also specify which species (e.g. <i>Mus musculus</i>) you are interested in. Use the <b>Species
            drop down</b> to specify your organism of interest. Once your selection is made, searching for a gene ID
            will restrict suggestions to the specified species.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h4> Search Results</h4>
        <p>
            Once you have selected the gene symbol of interest click <b>Search</b> and this will load a new page of
            all experiments where your selected gene is expressed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Search results can be filtered using the selection criteria along the left hand side of the search results
            page. Selecting a filter criteria will remove all non-applicable experiments from the search results. For
            example: selecting<b>Species: Homo sapiens</b> will show only human experiments, similar to searching only
            on the human specific gene symbol in the Home page Search bar. You can also select experiments where your
            gene of interest is expressed only in a particular <b>Organism part</b>or <b>Inferred cell type</b> by
            selecting these from the relevant drop-down menus.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, by clicking on the <b>"Marker gene"</b> filter you can return search results based on whether
            your gene of interest comprises part of the specific expression profile for a cluster.
        </p>

        <h4>Latest Experiments</h4>
        <p>
            This is a list of the latest experiments added to the Single Cell Expression Atlas, their title and
            upload date. You can click on the <b>Results</b> link or the experiment title to jump directly to the
            results page for that dataset. The number of assays is related to the number of sequencing runs. This is
            not equivalent to the number of cells as some cells do not pass sequencing file quality checks or you can
            have multiple sequencing runs or libraries generated from the same cell (technical replicates).

        <h3>Experiment page</h3>
        <p>
            Each experiment in Single Cell Expression Atlas has its own <b>experiment page</b>, just click on the title
            of any experiment to view it. At the top of the results page you will see the title of the experiment, the
            type of experiment and species information.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below the experiment information you will find a list of any associated publication(s).
        </p>

        <p>
            The Experiment page is comprised of four sections:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Results: this is where you can visualise the t-SNE plots (clustering and gene expression) as well as
                the marker gene heatmap of the data</li>
            <li>Experiment Design: this is where you can find the simplified sample metadata for the experiment</li>
            <li>Supplementary Information: here you can find the data analysis pipelines and corresponding
                documentation</li>
            <li>Downloads: links to the raw data files; analysis results and sample metadata files</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 class="anchored">Results tab

               href="#results-tab"></a>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Here you can view the results of the data analysis. This comprises of two visualisation methods: t-SNE
            plots and the marker gene heatmap. The t-SNE plots display subpopulations within the data and on the left
            and gene expression variation at single-cell resolution on the right. Each plot can be saved by clicking on
            the drop down menu symbol at the top right-hand side of the plot.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h5>t-SNE plot with clusters</h5>
        <p>
            These are found in the <b>t-SNE plots</b> tab under <b>Results</b>.

            <a href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/">t-SNE plots</a> are a useful way of visualising highly complex
            data in a 2D space. Although the size and distance between clusters is not very informative, manipulating
            the t-SNE perplexity value allows you to re-display the data in different ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            The number of clusters (<i>k</i> value) shows the output of the
            <a href="https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/scanpy.api.tl.louvain.html">Scanpy clustering
                algorithm</a>.
            Scanpy clusters cells into subgroups using the Louvain algorithm.
            This also colours the data to allow easier visualisation of different sub-populations within a dataset.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is also possible to colour the clusters by metadata! The colour legend for each
            group of cells is displayed along the bottom of the t-SNE plot.

            The metadata used to colour the clusters is derived from different experimental groups described by the
            authors. This is displayed in the <b>Experiment Design</b> tab along the top of the results page.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img style="max-height: 650px; display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="resources/images/help/tsne_colour_by_metadata.png" alt="t-SNE plot">
        </p>

        <p>
            You can hover over a single data point (cell) and a tool-tip will pop up. This displays the <b>single cell
            identifier</b> (a unique reference for that cell) and the <b>cluster ID</b> (which other cells share
            similar gene expression profiles). Additional information can include <b>cell type</b>: submitted cell type
            prior to sequencing analysis and/or the <b>inferred cell type</b>: cell type inferred by sequencing
            analysis based on gene expression profile.
        </p>

        <p>
            t-SNE plots are calculated at a range of perplexities by the analysis pipeline. The central value is
            selected by default. Clustering is performed over range of values for resolution in Louvain clustering by
            Scanpy (producing variable numbers of clusters), and by default the number of clusters corresponding to the
            default resolution of 1 is selected.
        </p>

        <h5>t-SNE plot with gene expression</h5>
        <p>
            Use the <b>Gene search box</b> to search whether a gene comprises part of a cells' expression profile.
        </p>

        <p>
            Expression levels are displayed as CPM (counts per million) and broken down into four different,
            logarithmic colour ranges:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Grey spot: expression level is below cutoff (0.1 CPM) or undetected</li>
            <li>Light blue spot: expression level is low (between 0.1 to 10 CPM)</li>
            <li>Medium blue spot: expression level is medium (between 11 to 1000 CPM)</li>
            <li>Dark blue spot: expression level is high (more than 1000 CPM)</li>
        </ol>

        </p>

        <h5>Marker Gene heatmap</h5>
        <p>
            Genes which comprise part of the specific expression profile for a cell population (cluster) are defined as
            <b>marker genes</b>. These are displayed - 5 per cluster in the <b>Marker Genes</b> tab under
            <b>Results</b>. Along the top of the page, you can specify the number of clusters or to view only a subset
            of clusters. As with the t-SNE plots, the heatmap can also be saved either an image or you can also
            directly download the data as expression values for each gene per cluster.
        </p>

            This tab displays the <b>Experiment design file</b> – a simplified table of the the sample metadata and
            experimental variables. <b>Sample characteristics</b> are generally intrinsic metadata required to
            understand each sample. <b>Experimental variables</b> are usually one or several sample characteristics
            that describe the experiment groups defined by the study aim. You can browse by row (each row is a single
            cell). You can also sort each column by clicking on the header row of your attribute of interest. Traverse
            the data by indicating the number of rows to view at the bottom and by clicking on the <b>Previous</b> and
            <b>Next</b> buttons.
